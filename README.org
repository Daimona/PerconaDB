* A Percona Database Driver for Percona XtraDB

You must set the environment variable MW_INSTALL_PATH to your mediawiki root to use this extension.

In order to install on a Percona DB this extension tells composer how to autoload it.  This is necessary so that when you specify “percona” as the db type via install.php, it can find the right db driver.

As a result, composer's autoloader has to be told about the MediaWiki autoloader.
